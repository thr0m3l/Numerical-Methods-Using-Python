# Numerical-Methods-using-Python
This repository contains code from Numerical Methods course that I am attending during Level-2/ Term-1 of my undergraduate studies in Dept. of CSE, BUET. A few of the famous numerical methods are implemented as a part of assignment given in sessional course. Here are the few numerical methods that are implemented:
  1. False position and secant methods
  2. LU Decomposition and Simplex optimization
  3. Curve fitting using polynomial regression
  4. Numerical integration using trapezoidal, simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rule
